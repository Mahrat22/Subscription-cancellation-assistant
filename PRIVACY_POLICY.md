Privacy Policy

Subscription Cancellation Assistant stores all user data locally on the user’s device using Chrome storage.

The extension does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data. It does not access email inboxes, payment information, authentication credentials, or browsing history beyond the active tab at the user’s request.

Any subscription information saved by the user (such as service name, domain, renewal date, notes, or category) remains on the user’s device and is not sent to external servers.

The extension does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising technologies.

Users may remove all stored data at any time by deleting saved subscriptions or uninstalling the extension.
